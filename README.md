## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16.x or later) and a package manager like `npm` or `yarn` installed on your system.

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(or `yarn install`)*

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    *(or `yarn dev`)*

    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (the port may vary).

4.  **Build for production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command will create a `dist` folder with the optimized, static assets ready for deployment.

## üîê Admin Panel

This portfolio comes with a built-in, client-side admin panel to manage content directly from the browser.

-   **Access URL**: Navigate to `/login` on your site.
-   **Default Password**: `admin`

**Important Note**: The authentication is for demonstration purposes and is **not secure**. The password is hard-coded in the source. For a production environment with real security needs, this should be replaced with a proper backend authentication system (e.g., Firebase Auth, Supabase, Auth0).

## üé® Customization

It's easy to make this portfolio your own!

1.  **Update Your Content**: The simplest way to add your own information is by editing the data files in `src/constants/data.ts`. Here you can change your profile details, social links, skills, services, and initial project list.

2.  **Change the Admin Password**: The default admin password can be changed in `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`. Find the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` constant and replace `'admin'` with your desired password.

3.  **Customize Styling**: All colors, fonts, and spacing are configured in the `tailwind.config` object within `index.html`. You can easily adjust the theme to match your personal brand.
